          <p>
            ElasticsearchE16 is a bitcoin payable web app designed for the 21 Marketplace to provide Elasticsearch as a service.
            Instead of signing up for an expensive monthly offering, you can use as little or as much of the service as you need
            and pay as you go.
          </p>
